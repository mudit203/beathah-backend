# 🛠️ Project Fixes & Corrections Documentation

This section outlines all the corrections and improvements made to the project during development and debugging.

## ✅ Configuration Corrections

- **To ensure compatibility with React 18, I have added an override in `package.json` to force `react-focus-lock` (a sub-dependency) to use React version `^18.2.0`**.

```
"overrides": {
  "react-focus-lock": {
    "react": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

- **Fixed incorrect database connection URI.**
- **Corrected build settings in `vite.config.js` / `webpack.config.js`.**
- **Resolved port conflicts in `server.js` or `index.js`.**
- **Adjusted CORS settings to prevent cross-origin issues.**
